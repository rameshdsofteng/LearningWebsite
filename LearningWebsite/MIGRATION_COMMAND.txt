# ⚡ MIGRATION COMMAND SCRIPT
# Copy and paste this entire command into Package Manager Console

# This single command runs all three migration steps:
Remove-Migration; Add-Migration InitialCreate; Update-Database

# Expected output:
# Build succeeded.
# Successfully applied migration 'InitialCreate'

# If that doesn't work, try individually:
# 1. Remove-Migration
# 2. Add-Migration InitialCreate
# 3. Update-Database
